## Build instructions

When building this adapter for AWS Lambda, there are a few extra steps:

After running `make zip adapter=google-finance`, 3 extra files will be created in the `google-finance/dist/` directory:

- aws.tar.br
- chromium.br
- swiftshader.tar.br

**These files needs to be moved inside the `google-finance-adapter.zip` file that was generated.** You can then upload
the updated zip and proceed with the usual steps.
